            <h2>ProFit</h2>
            <h4>Graphics, UX/UI</h3>
            <h4>Team: Christy Lam, Vicky Lau, Vincent Zhang, Winkie Ng</h4>
            <h4>Tools: Adobe Photoshop, Figma, Protopie</h4>
            <br>
            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>In the Interface Design course, our team, Unity, had to create an app that helps users in a professional context to adapt to the new balance between in-person and online activities under the COVID-19 pandemic. We decided to focus our app on the domain of fitness & health industry as our team understands that the pandemic has a significant impact on this industry. Thus, we created ProFit, an app that can help trainers to get through the tough times.</p>
            <p>As the sole UX/UI designer with internship experience on the team, I played a key role in driving success. I facilitated numerous workshops and guided the team through the UX research process.Throughout the design process, I actively listened, participated in discussions, and evaluated diverse perspectives from the team. My goal was to go beyond relying solely on intuition, and make informed and feasible design decisions that aligned with the needs of personal trainers. By working collaboratively with my team, I helped to bring the project to fruition.</p>

            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>
              We start by doing research on which domain we want to focus on. We chose fitness & health at last because all of us have friends working in this domain. We then researched how gyms had been running during the lockdown and after the restrictions have relaxed, as well as the challenges that personal trainers faced. After that, we created a fictional character based on our research in order to represent the target general user type, namely a persona, and created user flow, sketched wireframes, brand identity, and 4 sets of mock-ups using Protopie and UXPin.

              After getting more critiques from TA, we finalized our design and create an interactive prototype using Figma and protopie, and conducted a user study on 5 users to improve the functionality and user experience problem that we had.

              Vincent and I are responsible for creating graphics in Figma and editing video in Final Cut Pro, while Vicky and Winkie's role are creating an interactive prototype using protopie. Other than interaction, I am the team leader and I will distribute tasks to my teammate. I also responsible for making sure the logic in prototypes by using coding and creating logos and graphics by using PhotoShop.

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
              The main challenge throughout this project is implementing logic in our prototypes and ensuring the coding is able to run in protopie. At first, we only added jump interaction in our prototype and we noticed that it is not enough for logical use. Thus, we used coding condition in protopie, such as “if user didn’t input numbers, show a warning sentences”. The coding in protopie is different from what I learn in other courses. Therefore, I watched some tutorials in YouTube and their official website but it doesn’t work in my prototype. It still allows user to go to next page even they didn’t type numbers. I feel frustrated and keep watching tutorials but I still could not solve the problems. I tried different method by myself, and I solved the problem at last.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                Previously, our design approach prioritized the end-users as the most crucial aspect, a principle we learned in previous design courses. However, I realized that we needed to consider the needs and objectives of various stakeholders, such as business owners, developers, and end-users. Balancing these competing priorities with good design practices is essential in creating the best solution for a given project with limited resources. The success of a project often depends not only on its aesthetic appeal and usability but also on meeting the objectives and requirements of all relevant parties. This experience has taught me to simplify the user experience while delivering essential features that are relevant to our target audience.
