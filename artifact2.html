        <h2>The Clown On A Unicycle</h2>
        <h4>Product (UX/UI, 3D Modeling)</h4>
        <h4>Team: Christy Lam and Winkie Ng</h4>
        <h4>Tools: Illustrator, SolidWorks, Maya</h4>
        <br>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>In the Spatial Thinking and Communicating course, my team was tasked with creating an Animated Beautiful Model (ABM) using SolidWorks. An ABM is a machine that combines mechanical components with aesthetics to produce a pleasant and surprising output when users interact with it. We chose to create a model called "Clown on a Unicycle" because we wanted to make something fun, lively, and joyful.

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>
          To begin the project, our team brainstormed various ideas and discussed the possible movements that could be incorporated into our model. Our goal was to create a toy that would bring joy and cheer to those who interacted with it. We drew inspiration from Billy, a character from the horror movie Jigsaw, as well as Krusty the Clown from The Simpsons. We discussed and sketched rough designs for the model's housing and the mechanics of how it would operate.

        <p>The model performs three motions: right-hand up and down, leg curl, and wheel rotation (left).
          <br>There are top, front, side, and inside views showing how the mechanics work, as well as an isometric view with the 3D parts' name labeled. (right)

        <p>
          Based on the sketches, we created a digital model in SolidWorks to demonstrate the mechanical motion. For the hand motion, I separated the forearm and arm and connected the parts to a four-bar linkage mechanism that is attached to one of the gears. For the leg curl and wheel rotation, I made two holes in the gear and used a bar to connect one hole to each wheel and lower leg. To ensure that the leg curls to the front, I created a small circular rail and used a leg pin to connect the upper and lower leg.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          The main challenge throughout this project is transforming sketches into a 3D model since measuring the size of each part had to be precise. It was also a time-consuming task since I had to test the most suitable length of each motion mechanism to make sure they will not collide with other parts. In order to solve this challenge, I linked the mechanism part first and then adding the parts one at a time. This solution could help me make sure the mechanism motion is working and I do not have to keep changing the parts when I am testing the motion mechanism.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, I learned how to use sketches to communicate. During the design process, my team came up with different ideas, so we put them on paper and discussed which one to choose based on the mechanism, material for the model, and our personal preferences. I believe it's important to choose a design that we both like, otherwise, we may lose our passion for creating the model. I think we did a great job on this project because the model met our expectations.
